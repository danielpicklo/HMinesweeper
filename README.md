# HMineSweeper

Because nothing says "professional CRM tool" like a classic Windows 95 game embedded in your contact records.

## What is this?

It's Minesweeper. In HubSpot. On a CRM card. Because why not?

## Features

- **14x14 grid** because that's what fit on my screen
- **10 mines** because I am bad at Minesweeper. Sue me
- **No flagging** because adding that would've been annoying
- **Click to reveal** just like the good old days, but with more React hooks
- **Game over alerts** because the docs recommend them for UX

## How to Play

1. Click buttons. 
2. Don't click mines.
3. Win by clicking all non-mine buttons.
4. Lose by clicking a mine (obviously).
5. Click the robot icon to reset when you inevitably lose.

## Technical Details

Built with HubSpot UI Extensions using only their "standard components" because apparently that's a thing. Uses `Button`, `Flex`, `Alert`, and other components that HubSpot deems worthy. There are no scopes included with this app, so it is unable to interface with any data inside the account.

## Why?

Science isn't about why. It's about why not!
